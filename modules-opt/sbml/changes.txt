Version 0.0.2
=============
  * New metadata file used
  * New argument defined: DataSource
    * This makes guideline-conform use of the type CV
  * Evidence type corrected to IMPD
  * System.loadLibrary() deleted due to new version of ondex-mini, which loads it in the main class loader.
  * Missing SBO annotations now lead to exceptions being thrown.
