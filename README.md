# ondex-full
This is an aggregator repository, used to download and build all about ONDEX. 

**WARNING!**
You need to clone this repository with the ``--recursive`` option:

```bash
  git clone --recursive git@github.com:Rothamsted/ondex-full.git
```

or: 

```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rothamsted/ondex-full.git
```

Once you've done this, you'll have this repository in the ondex-full/ folder and, inside it, sub-folders (e.g., ondex-base/, knet-builder/) which are clones of respective repositories (this uses the [git submodule](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) mechanism).
