# ondex-full
This is an aggregator repository, used to download and build all about ONDEX. 

##Â Usage

Clone the usual way, then `run ./download_all.sh` to download the component GitHub repositories. Once you've done this, you'll have this repository in the `ondex-full/` folder and, inside it, sub-folders (e.g., `ondex-base/`, `knet-builder/`) which are clones of the respective repositories (this uses the [git submodule](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) mechanism).
