# Revision History

##Â v1.2.1-SNAPSHOT
  * OWL Parser
    * Internals: complete review of the [generic parser](https://github.com/Rothamsted/ondex-base/tree/master/core/parser-api) architecture, 
      which now has clear separation between [data source decomposition](https://github.com/Rothamsted/ondex-base/blob/master/core/parser-api/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/ondex/parser/Scanner.java) 
      and [mapping](https://github.com/Rothamsted/ondex-base/blob/master/core/parser-api/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/ondex/parser/Mapper.java). 
      The [OWL Parser](https://github.com/Rothamsted/ondex-knet-builder/tree/master/modules/owl-parser/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/ondex/parser/owl)
